## Overview

Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det is an integrated platform that combines FastAPI and Gradio to deliver real-time brain MRI tumor detection with an intuitive web interface. It enables developers to deploy diagnostic models efficiently, providing both API endpoints and interactive visualizations for medical imaging workflows.

### Why Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det?

This project simplifies deploying and interacting with machine learning models for medical diagnostics. The core features include:

- üîå **Dual-Interface Support:** Seamlessly access the system via REST API and interactive web UI for versatile workflows.
- üöÄ **Real-Time Detection:** Leverages a pre-trained YOLO model for fast, accurate tumor identification.
- üì∏ **Visual Results:** Upload images and visualize detected tumors directly within the interface.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Easy Deployment:** Unified architecture streamlines integration into existing medical applications.
- üì¶ **Environment Management:** Dependencies are managed for consistent setup and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Programming Language: Python
- Package Manager: Pip

### Installation

Build Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det from the source and install dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanrit/Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   Using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After completing the installation, you can run the application directly from the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start both the FastAPI server and the Gradio interface.

- The **FastAPI** server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
- The interactive **Gradio UI** will be available at `http://localhost:7860`.
- API documentation (Swagger UI) can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Running with Docker

Alternatively, you can run the entire application using Docker and Docker Compose, which handles all dependencies and setup automatically.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Instructions

1.  **For Windows Users:**
    Simply double-click and run the `build_and_run.cmd` script in the project's root directory.

2.  **For macOS/Linux Users (or manually):**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

After starting the container, the services will be available at the same addresses:

- **FastAPI Server**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Gradio UI**: `http://localhost:7860`
- **API Documentation**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
