## Overview

Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det is an integrated platform that combines FastAPI and Gradio to deliver real-time brain MRI tumor detection with an intuitive web interface. It enables developers to deploy diagnostic models efficiently, providing both API endpoints and interactive visualizations for medical imaging workflows.

### Why Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det?

This project simplifies deploying and interacting with machine learning models for medical diagnostics. The core features include:

- üîå **Dual-Interface Support:** Seamlessly access the system via REST API and interactive web UI for versatile workflows.
- üöÄ **Real-Time Detection:** Leverages a pre-trained YOLO model for fast, accurate tumor identification.
- üì∏ **Visual Results:** Upload images and visualize detected tumors directly within the interface.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Easy Deployment:** Unified architecture streamlines integration into existing medical applications.
- üì¶ **Environment Management:** Dependencies are managed for consistent setup and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Programming Language: Python
- Package Manager: Pip

### Installation

Build Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det from the source and install dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanrit/Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Fast-API-Server-Brain-Tumor-Det
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   Using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After completing the installation, you can run the application using Uvicorn (assuming the main FastAPI app is in `main.py`):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

- Access the FastAPI documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
- The Gradio interface may be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/gradio` or integrated within the app (check the code for specifics).
- Upload brain MRI images via the API or UI to detect tumors using the YOLO model.
